```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load some data
df <- read_csv("./got_avgs.csv") %>% 
  select(Series, Season, EpNum = SubEp, 
         OverallEp = TotalEp,
         Episode, Rating = UserRating, 
         Votes = UserVotes)
```

**The next trick we can do is put the code results inside of our prose.**

```{r}
# Get the highest rated episode
top10 <- df %>% 
  arrange(desc(Rating), desc(Votes)) %>% 
  head(10)

top_ep <- top10[1, ]
```

The highest rated episode of _`r top_ep$Series`_ 
is "`r top_ep$Episode`" with a rating of 
`r top_ep$Rating` from `r top_ep$Votes` votes.
