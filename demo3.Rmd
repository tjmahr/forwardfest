```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

We now have a variable indicating the data-set to load:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
filename <- "./got_avgs.csv"
```

***

Load some data: 

```{r, message = FALSE}
df <- read_csv(filename) %>% 
  select(Series, Season, EpNum = SubEp, 
         OverallEp = TotalEp,
         Episode, Rating = UserRating, 
         Votes = UserVotes)
```

Print the first 10 rows of the data as a table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(df, 10))
```

The data in a plot:

```{r}
title <- paste0(df$Series[1], " episode ratings")

ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = OverallEp, y = Rating, color = factor(Season)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ 1, se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Overall Episode Number",
       y = "IMDB Rating", 
       color = "Season",
       caption = "Lines: Season averages") +
  ggtitle(title) + 
  expand_limits(y = 7:10) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 16)
```


```{r}
# Get the highest rated episode
top10 <- df %>% 
  arrange(desc(Rating), desc(Votes)) %>% 
  head(10)

top_ep <- top10[1, ]
```

The highest rated episode of _`r top_ep$Series`_ 
is "`r top_ep$Episode`" with a rating of 
`r top_ep$Rating` from `r top_ep$Votes` votes.
